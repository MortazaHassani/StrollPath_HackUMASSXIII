## 🎯 Problem Statement

Navigating cities with a stroller is a daily challenge for millions of parents and caregivers. Traditional mapping applications like Google Maps or Apple Maps don't account for:

- ❌ **Steep stairs and inclines** that make routes impassable
- ❌ **Narrow sidewalks** difficult to navigate with a stroller
- ❌ **Rough terrain** that damages wheels and disrupts sleeping babies
- ❌ **Lack of curb cuts** at intersections
- ❌ **Construction zones** blocking sidewalks

**Impact:** 
- 4+ million families with strollers in the US alone
- Parents avoid outings or take significantly longer routes
- Reduced accessibility to public spaces and services
- Increased stress and anxiety for caregivers

## 💡 Our Solution

**StrollPath** is a web-based navigation application specifically designed for parents and caregivers with strollers. By leveraging Google Maps API and custom accessibility filters, we provide:

✅ **Stroller-friendly route planning** with accessibility preferences  
✅ **Real-time navigation** optimized for smooth surfaces  
✅ **Save and share routes** with other parents in the community  
✅ **Custom filters** to avoid stairs, steep hills, and obstacles  
✅ **Mobile-responsive design** for on-the-go navigation  

### Key Differentiators
